## What is an API? Give 3 examples where you use APIs by any company (eg Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc) in your daily lives?

- An API is a software which can be used by other softwares, to communicate with other softwares or even hardwares. It acts as a bridge between different softwares and devices.
- API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. So in the weather example, the bureau’s weather database is the server, and the mobile app is the client.

## Examples :

1. Pay with PayPal:
   - The “Pay with PayPal” functionality is built with APIs to ensure that the end application can only do what it needs to, without being exposed to sensitive data or gaining access to unintended permissions.
   - When the user clicks the “Pay with PayPal” button, the application sends an “order” request to the PayPal API, specifying the amount owed and other important details. Then, a pop-up authenticates the user and confirms their purchase. Finally, if everything goes to plan, the API sends confirmation of payment back to the application.
2. Twitter Bots :

   - Twitter bots are accounts that automatically tweet (or retweet), follow, and send direct messages based on software instructions. There are loads of bots on Twitter, but here are just a few of our favorites:

     - TinyCareBot:
       Sends hourly reminders to drink water, stretch, get fresh air, and more.
     - Grammar Police:
       Identifies common grammar mistakes made by its followers.
     - Netflix Bot:
       Tweets when new content is released on Netflix.

3. Travel Booking :
   - Travel booking sites are able to aggregate thousands of flights and destinations and showcase the cheapest option by using third-party APIs to collect flight and hotel availabilities from providers.
   - Likewise, if you make a booking through one of these services, they’ll use APIs to confirm the trip with the provider they sourced it from.
